"When they are victimized they are Muslims. When they victimize others
they are not True Muslims (tm) or no Muslims at all.
Quite annoying.
I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm. It is a basic
principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says ""I testify
that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God"" that,
so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one _must_
be considered muslim by all muslims. So the phenomenon you're attempting
to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
Islamic principles. If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts.
It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the
arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are
the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for
the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize
others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these
people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims
are the cause of a bad situation of another party."
"But, if you were to discuss the merits of racism, or its psycholgical
benefits, you would do well to have experienced it personally.
When you speak of ""experiencing religion"" you mean someone should believe in
a religion.
That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if
we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not
possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological
burdens, too.
When you speak of ""experiencing racism"", do you mean that someone should
believe in racism, or that they should have racist things done to them?  For
parallelism, the former must be what you meant, but it seems to be an odd
usage of the phrase.
Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually ""believing""
in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
originated it."

 Slavery makes economic sense (it NEVER makes MORAL sense) when human
 muscle power is an economically valuable asset. Agricultural slavery might
 have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no
 further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during
 the winter. 
 This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First ""agricultural""
 slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south
 slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all
 of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.
And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to
large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most 
valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of American slavery.
 Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to
 reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's 
 the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated
 the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the ""first
 mechanical cotton reaper"" was invented.
This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_
(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming?  When did this first appear?"
"For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National

like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit.
BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas

"  I am looking for any info I can get on the NEC 3D monitor.
  I know that it is a multisync but that is about all.
  I plan on buying one second-hand in a while depending on its specs.
  Does anyone know the min/max frequencies, whether it is interlaced, 
  non-interlaced, or both, video compatability, etc?
  I have seen a reference to it being .28 pitch with 1024 X 720 resolution 
  and that it supports SVGA from one source and that it doesn't support 
  SVGA from another source.  (Neither source seemed to have much reliable 
  info so I don't want to take a guess.)
  I'm at home right now, and so am away from my monitor files; the following
 is off the top of my head, subject to revision, worth-what-ya-pay-for-it
 sort of info.  If you don't hear from anyone who has spec sheet in hand,
 e-mail me and I'll look it up.
  If I'm remembering correctly, the 3D is a 14"" 0.28 mm pitch multisync that
 covers at least VGA (31.5 kHz horizontal, 60 Hz vertical) to 1024 x 768 
 60 Hz (which is going to be about 48 kHz horizontal).  It may go somewhat
 higher than that on the horizontal, but you won't be happy with anything
 beyond 1024 x 768 on a 14"" 0.28 tube; you probably won't be too thrilled
 with the 1024 x 768 on this tube, but it *will* sync up and display it.
 (I prefer at least a 16"" 0.28 for this resolution.)  Since SVGA is 800x600,
 it'll do that too.  The horizontal range probably goes lower than 31.5, but
 I don't know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSC-rate TV (which need
 about 15.75 kHz sweep).  As far as ""video compatibility"" (if I'm reading
 the question right: it won't take anything but analog RGB inputs.  In other
 words, it has no way to decode NTSC or Y/C video inputs.  You would need
 some sort of board to to this conversion - like the sorts of things that 
 let you display NTSC on a VGA display.
 Hopefully, now, I'll see this response of mine, and it'll remind me to
 look this stuff up and confirm it.  (Or force me to post a hasty retraction!)
Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input.
I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and 
non-interlaced as I have gotten conflicting info."
"Since I haven't been able to keep up with baseball much this season, I
have a few questions about my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins:
1.  How good does their rotation look?  The last I heard, the order is
Tapani, Erikson, Mahomes, Banks, and some guy I've never heard of. 
(sounds pretty pathetic to me)
Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley."
"I would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those 
SEATS will not be available for baseball games.  If you look at the picture 
of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked ""NOT FOR

they should happen to reach the post-season, I would imagine that they 
would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry 
of the future."

"    Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced
Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to
win.
     ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this
division.""
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical 150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't
afford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked and said: ""Well, maybe
Davis will get decked once.""
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.
     ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.""
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I
guess that's why they're so successful there.""  Indeed, it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season."

Statements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions about

(5) I do not believe that there is a god.
(6) I do not believe that there is not a god.

 Well, I haven't seen any reports of problems with the Turbo '040,

 later when A/UX compatibility is assured.  Turbo '040 interface

"I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable,
but I'd rather watch (and root for) the lower OBP guys who can
actually hit the ball.
Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than
others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the
slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of
it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.
Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's
inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he ""isn't
paid to walk"" or ""is an RBI guy"" or whatever.
And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them, than because they have a great ""eye""
I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming
convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot."

to use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere.
The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN
give excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic

"Hitler and the Nazis didn't spring fully formed from the forehead
 of Athena.   They didn't invent anti-semitism.   They built on a 
 foundation of anti-semitism that was already present in Germany.   
 This foundation of anti-semitism was laid down, not by the Nazis, 
 but by the people I listed, and also by hundreds of years of unthinking, 
 knee-jerk bigotry, on the part of perfectly ordinary people, and, of
 course, their pastors and priests.
 What we have to worry about today is not whether some Hollywood
 Hitler in a black uniform is going to come striding onto the German
 stage in one unprepared step, but whether those same bedrock foundations
 of anti-semitism are being laid down, little by little, in Germany,
 as we speak."
"My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region
in the past three years.  In fact, she tried to have her bone marrow
typed and they wouldn't even do that!  Why?
I can't donate blood either because not only have I been to a malarial
region, but I have also been diagnosed (and surgically treated) for
testicular cancer.  The blood bank wont accept blood from me for 10
years.  
Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
introducing another.  Cancer mestastizes.  My imperfect understanding of 
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. 
I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a 
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  Probably just a 
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  Transmissable diseases like 
malaria though are obviously another story."
"I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.
Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.
I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.
If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged."

"The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.
Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that
it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health 
system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue
the provincial health officials at all.
Since our doctors are private and the ""system"" is just an insurance
plan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise,
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.
Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it 
is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get 
more powerful.
A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash.
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies.
Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside
Ottawa.  Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some
studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients
there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't ""urgent""
at all.

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since
not all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff
that others don't?  (Ottawa's population is only a quarter million,
if you include the surrounding counties.)

The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are
approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions?  I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good
friends with one, you're put on any hospital's ""urgent"" care list no
matter how minor your problem. Which is OK unless you're someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.

People of influence will get their way in any system, American or
European.  It's the ""Golden Rule"" - he who has the gold makes the
rules. (-;

As for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities
(e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive
for-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services.

WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  

In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  
hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about 40 to $40  
a month.  

Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage 
of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included 
in the accounting?   Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much 
on health care as we do.

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)
disappears, as they were there before it appeared.

Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a
few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such
huge numbers, ""the services they expect from the province just won't
be there in a few years""

"I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 
For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.
With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.
Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty."
